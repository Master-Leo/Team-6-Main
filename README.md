[Project's Title] 

The relationship between Oil Price and US Inflation

[Background]

In the news, we always hear that oil price will lead to increased inflation. However, is that true? How does oil increase inflation? Is there a correlation between oil price and the rise in inflation? It’s clear that everything has become more expensive, so we wanted to figure out how much of it is related to oil price increase.

In this project, we will use Crude oil price, CPI, PPI and GDP data to find the relationship between oil price and household inflation. 

[Table of Contents]

We plot the trend of Crude oil price and all other CPI PPI sectors trend. 
We created the linear regression model between the Oil price and Gas price (CPI).
We created the linear regression model between the Oil price and energy price (CPI).
We created the linear regression model between the Oil price and food price (CPI).
We created the linear regression model between the Oil price and GDP changes. 

[Result]

In terms of inflation, oil prices directly affect the prices of gas and energy. Those are goods made with petroleum products. Oil prices don’t have direct relationship between the overall inflation, food price, and GPD growth. It may indirectly affect costs such as transportation, manufacturing, and heating, which we can compare the PPI data. 

[What we learned]

We made our hypothesis based on the news, but our results are different from what we assumed in the beginning. Oil price has some impact on inflation, but it’s not as big as what we thought it would be. There are many other outside factors that contribute to the rise of inflation.
